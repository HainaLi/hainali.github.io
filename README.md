## Haina "Hannah" Li ([Resume](https://hainali.github.io/pdfs/Hannah%20Li%20-%20Resume.pdf))

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Virginia (School of Engineering and Applied Science). I'm advised by [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and my research area is in web security and privacy.

In August 2017, I received my Master of Science degree from UVA in Computer Science. GPA: 3.97/4 

I will be starting as a full-time software engineer at Facebook in January 2018.
