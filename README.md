## Haina "Hannah" Li ([Resume](https://hainali.github.io/pdfs/Hannah%20Li%20-%20Resume.pdf))

<img width="250" align="left" src="hainali.jpg">

I'm a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Virginia (School of Engineering and Applied Science). I'm advised by [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and my research area is in web security and privacy.

I'm currently looking for a full-time position as a security/software engineer starting in the fall of 2017. I'm willing to relocate anywhere in mainland USA. 

In August 2017, I will receive my Master of Science degree from UVA in Computer Science. GPA: 3.97/4 

My main area of expertise is in web authentication security and privacy (see [Horcrux](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05085.pdf) paper). My research extensively uses applied cryptography (secret sharing ([Horcrux](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05085.pdf)), multi-party computation, and key cryptography ([DCA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03370.pdf))).  

I also have a special interest in machine learning, and how it could be used to solve many security issues. I've taken general machine learning, natural language processing, machine vision, and vision and language classes. 

"Haina Li" is my official name; I use "Hannah" to clarify any pronunciation confusions. The last name "Fan" is my married last name, but I kept my maiden name professionally to avoid any publication credit confusion. Sorry if all my names confused you!
