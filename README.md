## Haina "Hannah" Li ([Resume](https://github.com/HainaLi/hainali.github.io/blob/master/pdfs/Hannah%20Li%20-%20Resume.pdf))

I'm a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Virginia (School of Engineering and Applied Science). I'm advised by [David Evans](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) and my research area is in web security and privacy.

In the summer 2017, I received my Master of Science degree from UVA in Computer Science. 

All my publications should have the name "Hannah" on them, but you may still see places refer to me with the original spelling: "Haina".
